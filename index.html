    <h1>Twin chaser</h1>
    <p>This is a blog about why Twin chaser, The game we made at the Daydream hackathon, is the best game EVER!</p>

    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <br>
    <p>First off, the game is quite original. Yes, since I'm a noob when it comes to Godot, we made a 2d platformer game.</p>
    <p>But this isn't just your regular platformer. We wanted to make something original, something unique. And we had just the idea.</p>
    <p>Recently, me and my brother started beefing a lot for no reason, and since it was my brother who was the agressive one and would chase me a lot...</p>
    <p>We decided to call it Twin Chaser!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Twin chaser is a 2-player game. One person controls the brother, who is the one in red, and the other controls the younger brother, the one in blue.</p>
    <p>The objective of the older brother is to chase and catch the younger brother, while the younger brohter has to evade the older one!</p>
    <p>If the older brother catches the younger brother, they win, and if the younger brother evade the older brother for 30 seconds, he wins!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, the game is still a work in progress. there is only 1 map, limited movement options, no time change, ect ect.</p>
    <p>There are no power ups, no items right now, but more will eventually be added, since my friend who helped make the project is currently doing Daydream global!</p>
    <p>Still, the game is very fun, even in it's early stage. There are shortcuts to get to/away from the older/younger brother easier, looping mechanics, and more.</p>
    <p>You are at constant suspense because, since the map is so small and there are multiple ways to get to a location, someone can be at the opposite end of the map,</p>
    <p>then be right next to you in a split second. Not to mention the music gets higher and faster the more time elapses, creating suspense.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>In short, for what it is right now, I belive it is an awesome game! I encourage you to try it out...</h4>

    <h2>Tactics</h2>
    <p>There are different tactics the 2 characters.</p>
    <p>For the younger brother, who we will just call "runner", the main way of winning is to camp in specific spots, or if you prefer the more risky and fun way, to juke.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Meanwhile, for the older brother, who we will call the "chaser", you should focus on corner cutting and using shortcuts to your advantage.</p>
