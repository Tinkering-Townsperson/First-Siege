    <p>What inspired you to make twin chaser?</p>
    <p>Recently, my brother has started to beef with me. He would get angry for no reason and chase me around a lot, so the theme of it would be us chasing each other!</p>
    <p>The style of the game was suggested by a member of our group at Daydream. He remembered playing a Tom and Jerry game when he was young and Tom had to catch Jerry just like how My brother is trying to catch me! </p>
    <br>
    <p>What part did you contribute in Twin Chaser?</p>
    <p>I was the one who did all the art for the Twins, while my friend Paya did all the coding! Another friend did the design for the platforms and the floors, but I was the one to place them down.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Was it a sucessfull game?</p>
    <p>Personally, I felt like it was very sucessfull. Even though it didn't win any awards, our group was at the corner of the presentation area, and not much people visited it. Still, quite a few people did vote for it and I feel like</p>
    <p>If we had better positioning me might have actually won 4th!</p>
    <br>
    <p>What were your thought process behind the colour schemes used for both players?</p>
    <p>For the runner (who is based off me), I used to wear a blue sweater all the time, and my brother would wear a red sweater of the same brand with the same model. </p>
    <p>At the event, My friend suggested me using the same colour scheme as they are stark opposites and would display rivalry. Also, red tends to represent agressiveness, and that's what the chaser symbolises!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Woah, cool animations! Where did you animate them?</p>
    <p>I made the sprites and animated them on a website called Piskel, which is completely free to use! I personally used piskel kids, which had the same feutures but with no ads, but if you want to use the original Piskel, you can too!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Is the game free to play?</p>
    <p>Yep! Twin Chaser is completely free to play with no fees whatsoever! Find it on itch.io by serching "Twin Chaser"!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Are there bugs in the game right now? If there are, how can I fix them?</p>
    <p>If you click the credits and then click play, the credits screen will still be there, obstructing the game. Simply click escape, which will take you to the main screen, then click play again. That should do it!</p>
    <br>
    <p>What does the quit button do?</p>
    <p>The quit button used to do something, but now, since my friend's domain expired, unfortunately the button doesn't work anymore!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cool game! Can I share it with my friends?</p>
    <p>Of course! If they're interested, they can try it as well! Also, if you live in the tri-cities, you can join the FHC (Fraiser Hack Club), and learn all sorts of coding with my friend that helped make this game!</p>
